For every position in the string, find the breakdown (in percentage) 
for each symbol encountered. The goal of this exercise is to calcu-
late the population percentages for each symbol in each position, 
i.e.: what percentage of times do I see symbol X in position Y? From
the example input data, we would arrive at the following percentages:
 
Position: 1 (A: 0%,  C: 0%, G: 100%, T: 0%)
Position: 2 (A: 80%, C: 0%, G: 0%,   T: 20%)
etc.
